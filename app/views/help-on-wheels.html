    <p>ITNGateway provides over 900 rides per month in St. Charles County. The average cost to ITN of providing each ride is $12 (in addition to the fee paid by the rider). Our newest fundraising campaign, Help On Wheels, aims to cover the cost of these rides, and will allow ITN to continue to grow and serve the community.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>With a $12 per month recurring donation, you can support one ride per month to a St. Charles County or to a St. Louis County senior citizen, or disabled resident.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to collect 600 recurring donations of $12 per month each.</p>

        <p>It takes only a couple of minutes to sign up, and we will send you a Help on Wheels mug (In addition to a donation receipt for tax purposes).</p>
